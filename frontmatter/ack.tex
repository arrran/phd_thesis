This research was part of Antarctic Science Platform Project 1: NZARI Ross Ice Shelf Project and was funded by the Royal Society of New Zealandâ€™s Rutherford Discovery Fellowship (Contract: RDF-VUW1602). 
Additional funding support came from the New Zealand Ministry of Business and Innovation and Employment through the Antarctic Science Platform contract (ANTA1801) Antarctic Ice Dynamics Project (ASP-021-01). 
Our thanks to Antarctica New Zealand for the field support which was critical to the success of this research. 

% Additional thanks to Craig Stevens, Craig Stewart, Karen Alley, Irena Vankova, Dustin Carroll, Oliver Marsh for responding to emails with useful information.
A humongous thanks to my primary supervisor, Huw Horgan for genuine mentorship, support, encouragement and teaching. Thanks for fostering an environment which left me independent to learn and explore, but well supported when I sought help. Thanks to my secondary supervisor Brian Anderson for constructive guidance and thesis edits. 
Thank you to all other collaborators who supported and enabled this work. Wei Ji Leong, for remote sensing and python advice, Martin Forbes, for massive efforts collecting data, Alena Malyarenko for being a patient, expert teacher of MITgcm, continuously positive and extremely helpful.

Between waves of lock downs, thanks to the whole crew at the Antarctic Research Centre for fostering such a positive work environment. Thanks to Rob, Dao, Michelle and Aleksander for streamlining running of the ARC, administration and computer systems. Thanks to Meseret and Bereket for keeping the ARC in order, and for conversations and support. Thanks to the other PhD Students for camaraderie and fun times, the originals---Lauren, Wei Ji, and Clarrie, and later---Matt, Fran, Alana. 

Very thankful for ongoing, limitless support from Mum and Dad, Andrew, Emma, Lily and Lola.  It's no stroke of luck that I ended doing a PhD in Antarctic geophysics, with inspiring and supportive parents who've explored the field. Acknowledging the lockdown workmates---Blake, Henry, Bron, Joane and earlier flatties/friends, Laura, Dhaxna, Meg and Isaac, all cordial cooks, and palatable people.   
Thanks to the Wellington hills and beautiful southern coast for perfect runs and swims which fostered a good life. Cheers to the adventure mates, the BSR lads, the WoRM crew, and the TTC descendants, running, rogaining, skiing and biking.

Joane, thanks for the nail-on-the-head advice and engagement on completely new topics, but also---hunkering in the storm-battered tent at Tenneson, overlapping on the Tararua Mountain Race, finding a wh\=eke at Taputeranga, or cooking on the fire at M\=akara.

P.S. Lastly, six months later, thanks Lael!
